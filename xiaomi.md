# Bunny Installation Guide for Xiaomi ROMs
MIUI doesn't enjoy installing split-apk's without disabling MIUI Optimizations, you may fear turning the button off: or it may just not work! Do not fear, Shizuku is here.

First, you're gonna need Shizuku. It's kinda like rooting your phone without rooting it, you can find it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api&pcampaignid=web_share
Open Shizuku and follow the steps to pair and start Shizuku, you will need developer options enabled: go to device info and tap your Android version until it notifies you that developer mode has been enabled.

Then, open Bunny Manager; go to settings and change installation method to Shizuku. (You may need to authorize Bunny Manager in Shizuku first.)
After that, you may need to allow installing apps from USB.
There, you cheated the system, you broke MIUI's safeguards, you are free, and you can enjoy Discord but better.
